# Live Deposit Monitoring System

A production-ready Windows desktop application for continuously monitoring deposit transactions from a web panel and exporting them to Google Sheets.

## 🎯 Overview

**Read-only monitoring system** designed for 24/7 continuous operation with:
- Stability, reliability, and low resource usage
- Configurable filter profiles with priority-based execution
- Google Sheets batch export with retry logic
- SQLite-based transaction fingerprinting for deduplication
- Persistent browser sessions with manual login

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Electron** desktop application (Windows)
- **React 18** + **TypeScript** frontend
- **Playwright** browser automation
- **SQLite** (better-sqlite3) local database
- **Google Sheets API v4** for export
- **Zustand** state management
- **Winston** structured logging

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Create Windows installer + portable version
npm run dist
```

## 🎬 Output

The `npm run dist` command generates:
- `dist-build/Live Deposit Monitor Setup 1.0.0.exe` - Windows installer
- `dist-build/LiveDepositMonitor-Portable.exe` - Portable version

## 📋 Features

### Core Monitoring
- Priority-based filter execution (first-match-wins)
- Adaptive pagination (stops on already-processed transactions)
- SHA-1 fingerprint generation (User ID + Account + Amount + Process Date)
- Two-stage duplicate detection (SQLite + in-memory buffer)
- Auto-recovery after application restart

### Google Sheets Integration
- Fixed worksheet name: `MASTER`
- Auto-initialize headers if empty
- Column B: USER ID, C: AMOUNT, D: SHEET DATA (short fingerprint), E: TIME STAMP
- Batch export (up to 1000 transactions per batch)
- Automatic retry on failure

### UI Features
- Dark mode dashboard (operator-friendly)
- Real-time export statistics
- Connection status indicators
- Pre-run validation (8 checks)
- System tray integration (minimize to tray)
- Toast notifications + modal dialogs

### Transaction Processing Pipeline

The browser is the **single source of truth** for business filtering. Every row
visible in the deposit table has already passed every configured browser filter
(Status, Done, Deposit Type, Agent, Include/Exclude Keywords), so the backend
does **not** re-evaluate those decisions.

```
Apply Browser Filter          (every cycle starts from Page 1)
       ↓
Wait Search Complete
       ↓
Read Current Page  →  Parse HTML  (HTMLMapper — pure parser)
       ↓
Essential Field Check  (User Name, Account Number, Amount, Process Date)
       ↓
Generate Fingerprint
       ↓
Duplicate Detection  (SQLite cache + in-memory buffer)
       ↓
SQLite  (write-ahead as 'pending')
       ↓
Google Sheets  (batch append at B{firstEmpty}:E{firstEmpty+n-1})
       ↓
Mark Exported
       ↓
Resume Marker Advance  (SQLite `app_state('resume_marker')`)
       ↓
Next Page  (stop only when the current page is 100% duplicates)
```

The **only** scan-termination condition is: the current page contains at
least one parsed transaction, and every one of them is already known to
SQLite (or the in-cycle cache). No Process Date compare, no Resume Marker
compare, no Created Time compare. See "Scanning" below.

### Scanning

Every polling cycle begins with a fresh browser Search and always starts
from Page 1. The panel is ordered by **Created At** — new transactions
always appear on Page 1 of a new snapshot.

For each page the scanner:
1. Parses rows with `HTMLMapper` (pure parser + Production Layout Registry).
2. Runs the caller-supplied duplicate predicate (`fingerprint + SQLite`)
   against every row **for the stop decision only**.
3. Returns every parsed row (new AND duplicate) to `MonitoringEngine`,
   which then runs the full pipeline (Essential Field Check → fingerprint
   → dedup → buffer) exactly once per row.
4. If every row on the page was a duplicate → stop scanning. Otherwise
   click Next.

Resume Marker is **not** a scan stop signal. It exists only for:
- Startup recovery (loaded at initialize, cross-checked with Sheets col D).
- Crash recovery (persisted after every successful export).
- Dashboard / operational logging.

### Google Sheets Contract

Only **physical column letters** are part of the contract. Header labels may
be renamed at any time without affecting export or resume behaviour.

| Column | Purpose                             | Written by app | Source field |
|--------|-------------------------------------|:--------------:|--------------|
| A      | `NO.` (ArrayFormula)                | No             | —            |
| B      | USER ID                             | **Yes**        | `userName`   |
| C      | AMOUNT                              | **Yes**        | `amount`     |
| D      | KEY_ID (short fingerprint — Resume Marker source) | **Yes** | first 8 chars of `transactionFingerprint` |
| E      | TIME STAMP                          | **Yes**        | `createdAt` (falls back to `processDate` for pre-iter-9 retry rows) |
| F      | TRUE AMOUNT (ArrayFormula)          | No             | —            |
| G, H   | Reserved                            | No             | —            |
| I      | TX_ID (ArrayFormula)                | No             | —            |

`createdAt` is written into Column E so operators can reconcile the Sheets
row order directly with the deposit panel (which is sorted by Created At).
Fingerprint inputs are unchanged (`userName + accountNumber + amount +
processDate`) — the algorithm remains backward compatible.

- Insertion row is computed by scanning **Column B only** starting at B2 and
  finding the first empty cell (`getLastRow()` / worksheet metadata are
  ignored so ArrayFormula spillover in A/F/I never affects placement).
- Writes use `values.update` with an explicit `B{start}:E{end}` range so the
  ArrayFormula cells are physically untouched.

### Resume After Restart

- After every **successful** Google Sheets export + Mark-Exported step, the
  short KEY_ID (8-char upper-case fingerprint) of the newest exported row is
  persisted into SQLite `app_state('resume_marker')`.
- On `startMonitoring()`, the SQLite marker is cross-checked against
  Google Sheets column D. **Google Sheets wins** on disagreement (SQLite is
  a fast local cache; Sheets is the production source of truth).
- The Resume Marker is **never** used to stop scanning — it exists purely
  for recovery, dashboard, and diagnostics.
- The marker is **never** advanced on Sheets failure — a crash mid-write
  leaves the row `pending` in SQLite and the retry queue re-attempts on
  the next cycle.

### Essential Field Check
Required for a row to proceed past the parser:
- User Name
- Account Number
- Amount (numeric)
- Process Date

Any other fields (Bank, Account Name, Status, Done, Deposit Type, Payment
Type, Agent) are captured when present but are **not** re-validated —
those decisions belong to the browser filter.

### Production HTML Assumptions
This scraper targets one known production deposit panel, not arbitrary
HTML tables. The parser:

- Resolves canonical columns from the fixed `<thead>` labels for
  reporting purposes.
- Maps body cells to canonical columns via an **explicit production
  layout registry** (`PRODUCTION_LAYOUTS` in `src/main/services/html-mapper.ts`).
  Every legitimate `(headerCount, bodyCount)` shape has a hard-coded
  entry describing which body index maps to which canonical column.
- Fails fast on any unknown `(headerCount, bodyCount)` combination.
  The rejection diagnostic prints every header label, every body cell,
  and the raw `<tr>` outerHTML so the layout can be added explicitly
  without heuristics.

Currently supported layouts:

| Layout | Header count | Body count | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Modern production row | 17 | 15 | Server omits Payment Type (H13) and trailing verification column (H17). |
| Legacy full row | 16 | 16 | Older panel build; all columns emitted. |
| Legacy short row | 16 | 15 | Older panel build; Payment Type omitted. |

To add a new layout, add one entry to `PRODUCTION_LAYOUTS`; no other
file needs editing.

### Key Design Principles
- **Configuration-driven**: No hardcoded selectors, URLs, or credentials
- **Modular architecture**: Each service has single responsibility
- **Single source of truth**: SQLite for state, Google Sheets for export only
- **Never miss transactions**: Reliability > speed
- **Never duplicate**: Two-stage duplicate detection

## 📊 Performance Targets
- Idle CPU: <5%
- Monitoring CPU: <15%
- Memory: <400 MB
- 24/7 continuous operation
